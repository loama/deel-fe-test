## Deel Front End test

#### auto-complete component in React

## Running the project
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

This will make the project run in http://localhost:3000

### Requirements

- [x]  You cannot use any 3rd party libraries - only pure React and internal DOM
functions.

- [x] The function to filter the data should be asynchronous. You can use mock data (such as a JSON array), but the function which uses it should be asynchronous (similar to a real REST call).

- [x] It should have basic working CSS. No need for anything fancy (such as drop-shadows etc), but should look decent.

- [x] You need to handle all non-standard/edge use-cases - it should have a perfect user-experience.  `almost`

- [x] Bonus points if you highlight the matching part of the text and not only showing it.

- [x]  Prefer using plain JS, not TS

- [x]  No external state management libraries (refer to #1 as well), only native React method.

- [x]  Use only class components, feel free to use life-cycle methods if you need.

- [x]  Shortcuts and hacks are perfectly ok - BUT you have to add comments on what are you doing there and why. You should either write production ready code or include comments on what needs to be changed for production.

- [x] Add a README.md file explaining how to run the project.

- [ ] Bonus #1 now implement also as functional component with hooks.

- [x] Bonus #2 load data using a read API call to some resource.
